# wordpress-bf


This is a tool to enumerate the authors of a wordpress blog website and try bruteforce the logins.

Its not complete but it does work.

If you spot any horiffic code please submit a PR to fix it!

It will write the url and and user and password to a text file called found.txt
It will terminate once a login has been found.

I think on the todo:

* [] ignore a user
* [] if unable to find a method to get users allow manual.
